      <description>MeMy name is Ean Jacob Gayban, but I go by Jacob. I&amp;rsquo;m a graduate from the University of Nevada, Reno, currently living in the Las Vegas area. I am currently seeking employment, particularly for a junior web or backend development position. I&amp;rsquo;ve been writing a lot of Go lately, but I&amp;rsquo;ve worked with several other languages during my time in college, including JavaScript, C++, C#, Elixir, and Python. I&amp;rsquo;m open to learning new languages and technologies, and plan to continue learning more to expand my repertoire.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been following the Kettlebell Simple &amp;amp; Sinister program for a while now (144 days as of 4/28/2023), and I&amp;rsquo;d like to note down some tips that seemed to help during this time.
Practice your form. I spent my first two weeks simply practicing all the drills outlined in the first part of the book. Record your movements and fix any deficiencies. Experiment with your footwork and find what feels comfortable.</description>

      <description>This project was made to practice/review some concepts discussed in Alex Edwards&amp;rsquo;s Let&amp;rsquo;s Go and Let&amp;rsquo;s Go Further books. I also wanted to get a feel for how I wanted to structure my (web) applications in the future. Below is some discussion on the various sources that helped influence how this project came to be structured.
Let&amp;rsquo;s Go/SnippetboxI repurposed a lot of the template-handling code from the Snippetbox project into the Tourney Tracker.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been spending a lot of time on Hacker News lately, and like many other people I&amp;rsquo;ve taken to building a large backlog of links to several blog posts, articles, and discussions. It feels like a waste for me to clutter my bookmarks with links I end up not reading, especially when many of these links are interesting, insightful, or happen to be relevant to whatever I&amp;rsquo;m working on at the moment.</description>

      <description>Year of (A)VocationI&amp;rsquo;ve been listening to a lot of Cortex lately and I managed to catch up with the latest episode right around theme season, so I thought I&amp;rsquo;d give the yearly themes a try.
DescriptionThis year I will be graduating from college and entering the workforce. A lot of time will be opening up for me, and I want to use it to develop both my personal and professional interests, both of which I feel haven&amp;rsquo;t been given their proper attention.</description>
