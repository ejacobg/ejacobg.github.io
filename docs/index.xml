      <title>.NET Microservices: Architecture for Containerized .NET Applications</title>

      <description>After all that talk last time about how I&amp;rsquo;m not gonna read textbooks anymore, here I am with another reading project. This book just happened to catch me when I was low on both ideas and time, so reading just made the most sense.
If Microservices in .NET was a little below my level, then this book was definitely a much better fit. I found it particularly relevant in my new job, especially since many of the patterns and practices discussed were present in the codebases I&amp;rsquo;m trying to learn.</description>

      <description>Year of DiversificationNote: last year&amp;rsquo;s theme has now been updated with a retrospective.
DescriptionLast year, I thought I would have more time to myself after graduation since I no longer had any large responsibilities, but looking back it seems that the majority of my time and energy went into the job hunt. I neglected the personal side of last year&amp;rsquo;s theme in favor of the job hunt, so now that that&amp;rsquo;s over I&amp;rsquo;d like to try it again this year.</description>

      <description>Below are several questions I&amp;rsquo;ve asked and answered while in the process of building the Pastebin project. I originally wrote them down to help keep track of what I was currently working on, but I found myself revisiting the same questions from time to time. I figure this may not be the last time I&amp;rsquo;ll need the answers to these questions, so I&amp;rsquo;m posting them here for future reference. I cannot guarantee the correctness of any answers presented herein.</description>

      <description>MotivationComing off of the Microservices in .NET reading, I realized that going through textbooks like I&amp;rsquo;ve done for the past ~year may not cut it anymore. I think that the time spent reading and taking notes on a textbook may be better spent either reading the actual code of the project or documentation of the used libraries, or just actually writing my own code. It feels like I spent a lot of time just to re-discover the advice that&amp;rsquo;s been touted by anyone that&amp;rsquo;s ever written a &amp;ldquo;how to become a software developer&amp;rdquo; article: make your own projects.</description>

      <description>ReviewA week after finishing the Hacker News Feed project, I had found another book to work through: Christian Horsdal&amp;rsquo;s Microservices in .NET, Second Edition (2021). I was (and still am) interested in learning more about both microservices and the .NET stack, so this book couldn&amp;rsquo;t have come at a better time. The difficulty seemed reasonable, it had some projects I could take a look at, and it even covered deploying to Azure, which I did manage to get working.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been working with Go for the past ~1.5 years now, and while I would still like to continue working with it in the future, I realize that it isn&amp;rsquo;t exactly the most employable language in my area. Therefore, I&amp;rsquo;ve switched gears and started to learn C#. I did have some prior experience with the language and its related technologies through my senior capstone project and an elective class I took at UNR.</description>

      <description>This project was made to accompany my reading of Hands-On Software Engineering with Golang. Please note that the vast majority of this code was not written by me, however I did make a couple of meaningful changes: (1) I reorganized all the packages into a form I liked better (similar to the Standard Package Layout), (2) I rewrote a few of the tests (add links) to use the standard testing package rather than GoCheck, and (3) I got rid of a lot of old/deprecated code since the project isn&amp;rsquo;t exactly up-to-date.</description>

      <description>Let&amp;rsquo;s say that some parts of your code want to make use of a key-value store that looks something like this:
package kv // Store stores positive integers. type Store interface { Get(key int) int // Returns -1 if the key is not present. Put(key, value int) // Inserts a new item, updating it if present. Delete(key int) // No-op if key is not present. } You might then have some concrete implementations for your store:</description>

      <description>Some notes and my overall experience reading through Achilleas Anagnostopoulos&amp;rsquo;s Hands-On Software Engineering with Golang (2020). This won&amp;rsquo;t cover everything discussed in the book, just the points I thought were most helpful.
ReviewI went into this book thinking I could hit a lot of the keywords on my list: Docker, Kubernetes, gRPC, concurrency, software engineering, testing, and a project to add to my portfolio. In the loosest sense you could say I &amp;ldquo;hit&amp;rdquo; all of these topics, but some were more focused on than others.</description>

      <description>MeMy name is Ean Jacob Gayban, but I go by Jacob. I currently work as a software developer at Red Dog Media where I maintain various C# applications. I&amp;rsquo;ve worked with several other languages in college and in my free time including Go, JavaScript, C++, Elixir, and Python. I&amp;rsquo;m open to learning new languages and technologies, and plan to continue learning more to expand my repertoire. Currently, I&amp;rsquo;m revisiting C# and Vue.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been following the Kettlebell Simple &amp;amp; Sinister program for a while now (144 days as of 4/28/2023), and I&amp;rsquo;d like to note down some tips that seemed to help during this time.
Practice your form. I spent my first two weeks simply practicing all the drills outlined in the first part of the book. Record your movements and fix any deficiencies. Experiment with your footwork and find what feels comfortable.</description>

      <description>This project was made to practice/review some concepts discussed in Alex Edwards&amp;rsquo;s Let&amp;rsquo;s Go and Let&amp;rsquo;s Go Further books. I also wanted to get a feel for how I wanted to structure my (web) applications in the future. Below is some discussion on the various sources that helped influence how this project came to be structured.
Let&amp;rsquo;s Go/SnippetboxI repurposed a lot of the template-handling code from the Snippetbox project into the Tourney Tracker.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been spending a lot of time on Hacker News lately, and like many other people I&amp;rsquo;ve taken to building a large backlog of links to several blog posts, articles, and discussions. It feels like a waste for me to clutter my bookmarks with links I end up not reading, especially when many of these links are interesting, insightful, or happen to be relevant to whatever I&amp;rsquo;m working on at the moment.</description>

      <description>Year of (A)VocationI&amp;rsquo;ve been listening to a lot of Cortex lately and I managed to catch up with the latest episode right around theme season, so I thought I&amp;rsquo;d give the yearly themes a try.
DescriptionThis year I will be graduating from college and entering the workforce. A lot of time will be opening up for me, and I want to use it to develop both my personal and professional interests, both of which I feel haven&amp;rsquo;t been given their proper attention.</description>
