      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been following the Kettlebell Simple &amp;amp; Sinister program for a while now (144 days as of 4/28/2023), and I&amp;rsquo;d like to note down some tips that seemed to help during this time.

DescriptionThis year I will be graduating from college and entering the workforce. A lot of time will be opening up for me, and I want to use it to develop both my personal and professional interests, both of which I feel haven&amp;rsquo;t been given their proper attention.</description>
