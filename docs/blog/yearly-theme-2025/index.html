<h3 id="description"><a href="#description">Description</a></h3><p>January 3rd marks the end of my first year of full-time employment. This year was simultaneously the most and least productive I&rsquo;ve been in a while.</p>
<p>It felt like most of my energy just went into my job. I&rsquo;d get home and pretty must just laze about or hit low hanging fruit on my to-do list.</p>
<p>Typically, if I come up with some non-trivial task or project, I&rsquo;d add it to my to-do list for Saturday for later processing. As time went on, my Saturday list just kept growing, and instead of actually working through each item, I&rsquo;d end up just moving the due date to the following Saturday.</p>
<p><a href="/next-weekend.png"><img src="/next-weekend.png" alt="Next weekend"></a></p>
<ul>
<li>Infinite procrastination.</li>
</ul>
<p>At some point, postponing tasks seemed almost equivalent to checking them off - both actions struck them off the list. However, one action was clearly easier to do than the other.</p>
<p>Repeating this process for an entire year, and I ended up with a huge backlog of work.</p>
<p>The goal of the year of commitment isn&rsquo;t to get all of this done - in fact, I want to purge a lot of the stuff I don&rsquo;t care about. I think that one of the reasons I procrastinated on a lot of things this year because I wasn&rsquo;t able to fully commit to anything. Something else always seemed to pop up and take my attention away. I want to get in the habit of sticking with a project for the long-term, as well as actually being able to finish what I started, or at least get to a point where I&rsquo;ve achieved some tangible outcome.</p>
<p>If the goal of last year&rsquo;s theme was to focus on a greater number of things, then this year&rsquo;s theme will be about focusing on less, but over a longer timeframe. My efforts will concentrate around the following 4 categories, roughly ordered by importance:</p>
<ul>
<li>Coding/Career</li>
<li>Blogging</li>
<li>Biking/Health</li>
<li>Reading/Small Projects</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="ideal-outcomes"><a href="#ideal-outcomes">Ideal Outcomes</a></h3><p>Really any sort of progress on these main categories will count. This year is all about making consistent, long-term effort.</p>
<h4 id="codingcareer"><a href="#codingcareer">Coding/Career</a></h4><p>Finish eShopOnContainers.</p>
<p>Work through roadmaps:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://roadmap.sh/backend">Backend</a></li>
<li><a href="https://roadmap.sh/aspnet-core">ASP.NET Core</a></li>
<li><a href="https://roadmap.sh/api-design">API Design</a></li>
<li><a href="https://roadmap.sh/software-design-architecture">Software Design and Architecture</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer">System Design Primer</a></li>
<li><a href="https://roadmap.sh/software-architect">Software Architect</a></li>
</ul>
<h4 id="blogging"><a href="#blogging">Blogging</a></h4><p>From last year:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Continue maintaining the blog, and incorporate more <code>blog</code> and <code>notes</code> posts.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="bikinghealth"><a href="#bikinghealth">Biking/Health</a></h4><p>Bike to all the local libraries.</p>
<p>Come up with a healthy meal plan/shopping list.</p>
<h4 id="everything-else"><a href="#everything-else">Everything Else</a></h4><p>Finish 3 books unrelated to the above categories.</p>
<p>Resolve some lower-priority tasks on the backlog.</p>
<h3 id="daily-themes"><a href="#daily-themes">Daily Themes</a></h3><p>I&rsquo;m actually gonna forgo the daily themes this year. I don&rsquo;t get much value out of habit tracking this way, and I never checked my daily themes last year.</p>
