            <h2 id="year-of-diversification"><a href="#year-of-diversification">Year of Diversification</a></h2><p><em>Note: <a href="https://ejacobg.com/blog/yearly-theme-2023/">last year&rsquo;s theme</a> has now been updated with a retrospective.</em></p>
<h3 id="description"><a href="#description">Description</a></h3><p>Last year, I thought I would have more time to myself after graduation since I no longer had any large responsibilities, but looking back it seems that the majority of my time and energy went into the job hunt. I neglected the personal side of last year&rsquo;s theme in favor of the job hunt, so now that that&rsquo;s over I&rsquo;d like to try it again this year. The theme of diversification comes in two main parts.</p>
<p><strong>Diversification of Interests</strong> - I finally have a source of income I can actually
<em>do</em> things with, so I&rsquo;d like to put more time (and money) into the things I want to pursue (other than coding).</p>
<p><strong>Diversification of Responsibilities</strong> - I imagine that this upcoming year will be marked by my having to balance a lot of new responsibilities at the same time. I want to use this year to get my life and affairs in order to not be as unbalanced as I was last year.</p>
<p>Ultimately though, the year of diversification is aimed at becoming able to manage all the various aspects of my life in a reasonable and sustainable manner, to test my limits on how far I can (responsibly) stretch myself, and to work through some of the <em>other</em> tasks on my to-do list, not just the most important ones.</p>
<h3 id="ideal-outcomes"><a href="#ideal-outcomes">Ideal Outcomes</a></h3><p>Define short- and long-term career goals.</p>
<p>Make an accomplishment or complete a project in at least 3 different non-coding areas.</p>
<p>Continue maintaining the blog, and incorporate more <code>blog</code> and <code>notes</code> posts.</p>
<p>Buy a car or look into alternative methods of transportation.</p>
<p>Deepen my &ldquo;home economics&rdquo;/&ldquo;adulting&rdquo; knowledge and have a better grasp on new responsibilities.</p>
<p>Develop my technical skills even further; get more comfortable using .NET.</p>
<h3 id="daily-themes"><a href="#daily-themes">Daily Themes</a></h3><p>Have I made progress on a technical skill, course, book, or project?</p>
<p>Are there any areas of my life that I haven&rsquo;t touched on in a while?</p>
<p>Did I do (or learn how to do) some chores/maintenance around the house?</p>
<p>Have I developed ideas for the blog, either through reading or writing?</p>
