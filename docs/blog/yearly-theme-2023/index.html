            <h2 id="year-of-avocation"><a href="#year-of-avocation">Year of (A)Vocation</a></h2><p>I&rsquo;ve been listening to a lot of <a href="https://www.relay.fm/cortex">Cortex</a> lately and I managed to catch up with the latest episode right around theme season, so I thought I&rsquo;d give the yearly themes a try.</p>
<h3 id="description"><a href="#description">Description</a></h3><p>This year I will be graduating from college and entering the workforce. A lot of time will be opening up for me, and I want to use it to develop both my personal and professional interests, both of which I feel haven&rsquo;t been given their proper attention.</p>
<p>On the personal (avocational) side, I want to develop the interests I&rsquo;ve found recently, as well as exploring any new ones I may come across.</p>
<p>On the professional (vocational) side, I want to use this year to make a plan for my career, or at least find a direction I&rsquo;m comfortable pursuing. I want to further my technical skills so I can build things for myself, as well as any prospective employers. Finally, I want to do my best at the job I currently have, while also preparing myself for the one that I want.</p>
<h3 id="ideal-outcomes"><a href="#ideal-outcomes">Ideal Outcomes</a></h3><p>Find full-time employment by the end of 2023.</p>
<p>Spend more time working on this site.</p>
<p>Gain proficiency in a tech stack of choice.</p>
<p>Read more, take notes, and develop my knowledge base.</p>
<p>Plan out short- and long-term career goals.</p>
<p>Explore interests, with a focus on having fun rather than striving for some goal.</p>
<h3 id="daily-themes"><a href="#daily-themes">Daily Themes</a></h3><p>Have I made progress on a technical skill, course, book, or project?</p>
<p>Did I spend time on interests and hobbies (that aren&rsquo;t social media)?</p>
<p>Did I show up in-person at least 3 times this week?</p>
<p>Have I spent time looking for jobs or considering career paths?</p>
