            <h2 id="year-of-avocation"><a href="#year-of-avocation">Year of (A)Vocation</a></h2><p>I&rsquo;ve been listening to a lot of <a href="https://www.relay.fm/cortex">Cortex</a> lately and I managed to catch up with the latest episode right around theme season, so I thought I&rsquo;d give the yearly themes a try.</p>
<h3 id="description"><a href="#description">Description</a></h3><p>This year I will be graduating from college and entering the workforce. A lot of time will be opening up for me, and I want to use it to develop both my personal and professional interests, both of which I feel haven&rsquo;t been given their proper attention.</p>
<p>On the personal (avocational) side, I want to develop the interests I&rsquo;ve found recently, as well as exploring any new ones I may come across.</p>
<p>On the professional (vocational) side, I want to use this year to make a plan for my career, or at least find a direction I&rsquo;m comfortable pursuing. I want to further my technical skills so I can build things for myself, as well as any prospective employers. Finally, I want to do my best at the job I currently have, while also preparing myself for the one that I want.</p>
<h3 id="ideal-outcomes"><a href="#ideal-outcomes">Ideal Outcomes</a></h3><p>Find full-time employment by the end of 2023.</p>
<p>Spend more time working on this site.</p>
<p>Gain proficiency in a tech stack of choice.</p>
<p>Read more, take notes, and develop my knowledge base.</p>
<p>Plan out short- and long-term career goals.</p>
<p>Explore interests, with a focus on having fun rather than striving for some goal.</p>
<h3 id="daily-themes"><a href="#daily-themes">Daily Themes</a></h3><p>Have I made progress on a technical skill, course, book, or project?</p>
<p>Did I spend time on interests and hobbies (that aren&rsquo;t social media)?</p>
<p>Did I show up in-person at least 3 times this week?</p>
<p>Have I spent time looking for jobs or considering career paths?</p>
<h3 id="reflection"><a href="#reflection">Reflection</a></h3><p><em>December 26, 2023</em></p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t complete every single thing in my ideal outcomes, but I did hit all my &ldquo;major&rdquo; goals.</p>
<ul>
<li>Full-time employment - received offer letter December 22.</li>
<li>Work on the blog - made 11 posts this year, and have a few ideas for more.</li>
<li>Proficiency in tech - hard to quantify this, but I did learn a lot this year.</li>
<li>Develop knowledge base - yes.</li>
<li>Career goals - haven&rsquo;t thought about this any deeper than &ldquo;learn as much as I can&rdquo;.</li>
<li>Explore interests - unfortunately this goal was neglected.</li>
</ul>
<p>Those last 2 goals might actually be easier to reach now that I&rsquo;ve started working. Some concrete work experience would allow me to make a more realistic career plan, and I&rsquo;ll also have some money to put into my interests.</p>
<p>This year, I estimate I spent ~600 hours doing some sort of focused work that I deemed &ldquo;productive&rdquo; (eg. reading books, coding, applying to jobs). This doesn&rsquo;t include time I spent at work or going to class (although I do believe this figure includes time spent studying and doing homework). Outside of it being &ldquo;nice to know&rdquo;, this number doesn&rsquo;t really hold much meaning to me. My time tracking habit sort of appeared on a whim and I happened to keep it going this entire time. I don&rsquo;t have any other records before this year, so this number will have to be my &ldquo;baseline&rdquo; to compare future years against.</p>
<ul>
<li>I know this doesn&rsquo;t have anything to do with the theme itself, but since I&rsquo;m doing a retrospective, I thought I would just put it here.</li>
</ul>
