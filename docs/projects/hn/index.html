            <p>I&rsquo;ve been spending a lot of time on Hacker News lately, and like many other people I&rsquo;ve taken to <a href="https://andreisurugiu.com/blog/bad-habit/">building a large backlog</a> of links to several blog posts, articles, and discussions. It feels like a waste for me to clutter my bookmarks with links I end up not reading, especially when many of these links are interesting, insightful, or happen to be relevant to whatever I&rsquo;m working on at the moment. I&rsquo;ve saved these things because past-me thought they would be useful in some way.</p>
<p>If you ever feel the need to read something, doesn&rsquo;t it make the most sense to start from your bookmarks? What better recommendation algorithm could there be other than your past self?</p>
<p>HN doesn&rsquo;t provide a good way to navigate through your saved items, so I wrote up a small program to help download all my favorite and upvoted posts. This way, I get to see everything at once rather than 30 at a time, and I can reorganize them however I like. In the future, I&rsquo;d like to generalize this program to work with links from any source, but since most of my links come from HN, this is a good enough solution for now.</p>
<p>I tend to read a lot more posts than I save, so in theory I should be able to read (or at least decide to read) all of my saved items pretty quickly. In practice though, I tend to go back to the front page to get my fix rather than reading something from my favorites. I guess my past self doesn&rsquo;t know me as well as he thought he did.</p>
