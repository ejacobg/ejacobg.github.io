      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been spending a lot of time on Hacker News lately, and like many other people I&amp;rsquo;ve taken to building a large backlog of links to several blog posts, articles, and discussions. It feels like a waste for me to clutter my bookmarks with links I end up not reading, especially when many of these links are interesting, insightful, or happen to be relevant to whatever I&amp;rsquo;m working on at the moment.</description>
