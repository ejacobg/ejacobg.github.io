      <description>This project was made to practice/review some concepts discussed in Alex Edwards&amp;rsquo;s Let&amp;rsquo;s Go and Let&amp;rsquo;s Go Further books. I also wanted to get a feel for how I wanted to structure my (web) applications in the future. Below is some discussion on the various sources that helped influence how this project came to be structured.
Let&amp;rsquo;s Go/SnippetboxI repurposed a lot of the template-handling code from the Snippetbox project into the Tourney Tracker.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been spending a lot of time on Hacker News lately, and like many other people I&amp;rsquo;ve taken to building a large backlog of links to several blog posts, articles, and discussions. It feels like a waste for me to clutter my bookmarks with links I end up not reading, especially when many of these links are interesting, insightful, or happen to be relevant to whatever I&amp;rsquo;m working on at the moment.</description>
