      <description>Below are several questions I&amp;rsquo;ve asked and answered while in the process of building the Pastebin project. I originally wrote them down to help keep track of what I was currently working on, but I found myself revisiting the same questions from time to time. I figure this may not be the last time I&amp;rsquo;ll need the answers to these questions, so I&amp;rsquo;m posting them here for future reference. I cannot guarantee the correctness of any answers presented herein.</description>

      <description>ReviewA week after finishing the Hacker News Feed project, I had found another book to work through: Christian Horsdal&amp;rsquo;s Microservices in .NET, Second Edition (2021). I was (and still am) interested in learning more about both microservices and the .NET stack, so this book couldn&amp;rsquo;t have come at a better time. The difficulty seemed reasonable, it had some projects I could take a look at, and it even covered deploying to Azure, which I did manage to get working.</description>

      <description>Let&amp;rsquo;s say that some parts of your code want to make use of a key-value store that looks something like this:
package kv // Store stores positive integers. type Store interface { Get(key int) int // Returns -1 if the key is not present. Put(key, value int) // Inserts a new item, updating it if present. Delete(key int) // No-op if key is not present. } You might then have some concrete implementations for your store:</description>

      <title>Hands-On Software Engineering With Golang</title>

      <description>Some notes and my overall experience reading through Achilleas Anagnostopoulos&amp;rsquo;s Hands-On Software Engineering with Golang (2020). This won&amp;rsquo;t cover everything discussed in the book, just the points I thought were most helpful.
ReviewI went into this book thinking I could hit a lot of the keywords on my list: Docker, Kubernetes, gRPC, concurrency, software engineering, testing, and a project to add to my portfolio. In the loosest sense you could say I &amp;ldquo;hit&amp;rdquo; all of these topics, but some were more focused on than others.</description>
