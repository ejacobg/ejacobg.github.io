      <description>Some notes and my overall experience reading through Achilleas Anagnostopoulos&amp;rsquo;s Hands-On Software Engineering with Golang (2020). This won&amp;rsquo;t cover everything discussed in the book, just the points I thought were most helpful.
ReviewI went into this book thinking I could hit a lot of the keywords on my list: Docker, Kubernetes, gRPC, concurrency, software engineering, testing, and a project to add to my portfolio. In the loosest sense you could say I &amp;ldquo;hit&amp;rdquo; all of these topics, but some were more focused on than others.</description>
