            <h2 id="me"><a href="#me">Me</a></h2><p>My name is Ean Jacob Gayban, but I go by Jacob. I&rsquo;m a graduate from the University of Nevada, Reno, currently living in the Las Vegas area. I am currently seeking employment, particularly for a junior web or backend development position. I&rsquo;ve been writing a lot of Go lately, but I&rsquo;ve worked with several other languages during my time in college, including JavaScript, C++, C#, Elixir, and Python. I&rsquo;m open to learning new languages and technologies, and plan to continue learning more to expand my repertoire. Java is next on the list of languages I plan to experiment with.</p>
<p>Outside of work (or lack thereof), I enjoy writing programs to make my life easier. I&rsquo;ve written a web scraper to download recipes as JSON, a bookmark manager/read-it-later application for organizing links to saved articles, and a web application that was used by a local Esports league to rank their players. I spend a lot of time reading books on technology and programming (although it&rsquo;s mostly been about Go as of late), and have several books on my ever-growing reading list to get through. I realize that my journey is only just beginning and the fact that there&rsquo;s still so much left to learn excites me.</p>
<p>In my free time, I enjoy reading (mostly self-help and productivity), playing video games (I want to get back into <a href="https://rivalsofaether.com/">Rivals</a>), and occasionally watching anime.</p>

<h2 id="this-site"><a href="#this-site">This Site</a></h2><p>I started this blog to help organize and share my thoughts and my projects. I&rsquo;ve never had much of an online presence before, but have recently begun to see the value in having one. This blog is primarily tech-focused, but I plan to record whatever&rsquo;s interesting to me on here.</p>
<p>This site was built with the <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a> static site generator, using a custom <a href="https://github.com/ejacobg/theme">theme</a> that I wrote. It is hosted on GitHub Pages. You can find the site repository <a href="https://github.com/ejacobg/ejacobg.github.io">here</a>.</p>
<h2 id="my-projects"><a href="#my-projects">My Projects</a></h2><p>You can find the code for all of my projects on my <a href="https://github.com/ejacobg">GitHub</a>. Any non-coding projects will be documented here on this site.</p>
