            <p>I recently came across <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38983067">this Ask HN thread</a> asking if other people are also currently working on &ldquo;absolutely nothing&rdquo; lately. I definitely resonate with this right now as I haven&rsquo;t been able to get much of anything done these past 2 weeks.</p>
<p>Reading is the biggest source of &ldquo;everything&rdquo; in my life - motivation, ideas, wisdom, advice, <em>character</em> (although to a lesser extent). There is value in my other pursuits like watching videos and playing games, but they are definitely overrepresented in my life right now. I haven&rsquo;t been reading HN like I used to, and it&rsquo;s a damn shame.</p>
<p><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38986422">What would I do if I were fired tomorrow?</a></p>
<p>If I were fired tomorrow, I would probably go back to what I was doing before I got this job - studying and working on projects and the blog. But looking back though, this wasn&rsquo;t exactly the most exciting time of my life. I spent a little too much time on the grind, and I&rsquo;m not sure I got enough excitement out of it.</p>
<p>If I did have the choice to spend my time however I&rsquo;d like, and with an unlimited budget, I would still spend some time on my reading and projects, but much less. I want to be able to go out and do things, even if just riding around the city or spending an afternoon cooking. I want to do more and be more outside of coding, which I still value doing in itself.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t given this much thought, but it seems like good advice. Once I have money, I think it would be a <em>lot</em> easier to get rid of pretty much all of the small inconveniences I have in my life.</p>
<p><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38984101">I&rsquo;m working on becoming someone.</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>That&rsquo;s a combination of figuring out what things are just given in my life&ndash;that I am or I like or I want unprompted, naturally&ndash;and what things I choose, where I&rsquo;ll actually make an assessment from my values and apply my will and effort to making a change. Hopefully once I do this, I&rsquo;ll be able to be someone who works on something, instead of living the remainder of my life afraid of the responsibility, and continuing to be no one working on nothing.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The two biggest factors in me not having developed myself all that much are probably &ldquo;freedom&rdquo; and &ldquo;initiative&rdquo;. Freedom as in physical freedom - being able to go wherever I want at any time. I&rsquo;ve been cooped up inside for too long, and have gotten used to not really exploring the things around me. Initiative means actually taking steps to <em>do</em> something, even if my interest in it is only passing. Taking the initiative to explore. Taking the initiative to get out of bed. Taking the initiative to run to the store and make some recipe I found online.</p>
<p>Getting that bike seems so much more important now.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Agency&rdquo; also seems like good term for what I&rsquo;m describing.</p>
<p><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38984401">If you&rsquo;re feeling like you&rsquo;re stagnating, here are some ideas to help get you jump started that I&rsquo;ve done over the years.</a></p>
<p>Just a list of great ideas to spend a little time on.</p>
<p>Online courses and certifications are a great way to dive deep into subjects. Communication, cooking, drawing, coding, medicine, whatever.</p>
