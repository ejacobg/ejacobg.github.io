            <p>It&rsquo;s kinda frustrating putting in the work to chase my goals, but not really feeling much progress toward them. I know I&rsquo;m still very early in my career, but that&rsquo;s part of the issue. It feels like I&rsquo;ve put in all these hours just to get to the starting line. How much longer will I have to keep at this to become half the programmer I imagine myself to be? I can dream and follow roadmaps all I like, but the actual path I tread is so much different than the route I planned for myself. Today I spent 47 minutes trying to get a stupid fucking datalist element to render correctly, and barely accomplished even that. How did this exercise make me better than yesterday? It&rsquo;s hard to keep aligned with my long-term vision while being tasked with items that are only tangentially related to them. It&rsquo;s hard to see progress when I&rsquo;m lost in the weeds. At the same time though, dreaming and planning with my head in the clouds won&rsquo;t get me any closer to those goals either.</p>
<p>I know that I just so happen to be stuck with some frontend work for the time being. It&rsquo;s part of what I signed up for, so I can&rsquo;t complain too much. Like with anything else, I think I need to get used to it. I was thrown into this project without a lot of experience using the framework (or frontend work in general), and that&rsquo;s where a lot of my frustration comes from. I need a better grasp of how well I&rsquo;m meeting my goals, as well as a better mindset about the work that I&rsquo;m currently doing. I can afford to take a couple of detours, and in fact the Year of Diversification demands it.</p>
