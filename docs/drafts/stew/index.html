<p>Most great scientists know many important problems. They have something between 10 and 20 important problems for which they are looking for an attack. And when they see a new idea come up, one hears them say &ldquo;Well that bears on this problem.&rsquo;&rsquo; They drop all the other things and get after it.

<p>I have a lot of recurring problems and questions in my life. Most of the time I&rsquo;ll remember to write them down in my journal, but soon forget about them as the next batch of recurring problems and questions bubbles up from the back of my mind.</p>
<p>I need some sort of place where I can jot down ideas as they come up, but also have any previous ideas accessible at my fingertips. Right now, I&rsquo;m using Logseq&rsquo;s &ldquo;Journals&rdquo; feature, which fits the first criteria (writing things down), but is poor at the second (presentation/retrieval). Of course, the search feature always exists, but it&rsquo;s no substitute for an actual &ldquo;dashboard&rdquo; of my ideas.</p>
<p>Stewing on Thoughts
I&rsquo;ve written this in the journal before but I have a lot of one off thoughts that never get expanded upon for more than a week. Go through the journal and collect these thoughts. Organize them if you have to. Do whatever to polish them up as best you can.
Take the Grey approach and gather your ideas as a project with some codename in front of it. This idea would be something like &ldquo;stew&rdquo;.</p>
<p>One way to actually expand upon my ideas is to gather them into a single place. Something like a blog might be good for this. Develop your thoughts into some sort of finished form and post it on the blog.</p>
<p>My knowledge base has become full of literature notes, and very little &ldquo;main&rdquo; notes. I have a lot of highlights, but no summaries and takeaways. I like the idea of progressive summarization though. The process of actually making a main note - something standalone and includes all context - is kinda difficult.</p>
