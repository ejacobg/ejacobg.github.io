            <p>Discontinued: Although I would like to recount my job hunting experience, this article just isn&rsquo;t it. Maybe write a &ldquo;first job&rdquo; article instead.</p>
<p>Here is a small recount of my first job hunt during the Spring/Summer of 2023 and how I approached it.</p>
<h2 id="skills"><a href="#skills">Skills</a></h2><h3 id="education"><a href="#education">Education</a></h3><p>I went into the job search with a degree in Computer Science &amp; Engineering, a minor in Statistics, and a minor in Big Data. I also took two external courses during my time in college, those being the Full Stack Open and Google&rsquo;s Data Analytics Certification, both completed in 2022. I supplemented by learning in college with a lot of self-study, mostly through textbooks.</p>
<h3 id="experience"><a href="#experience">Experience</a></h3><p>I did not take any internships during my time in college. I did get a job during my senior year, however it was unrelated to tech. My coding experience mainly came from school, side projects, and external courses. Despite this, I believe I was very solidly at the junior level.</p>
<h2 id="preferences"><a href="#preferences">Preferences</a></h2><h3 id="job-choice"><a href="#job-choice">Job Choice</a></h3><p>I was mainly looking for full-stack or backend development roles. I was also interested in cloud development and DevOps positions, but there weren&rsquo;t many openings for them at the junior level. The particular industry didn&rsquo;t matter much to me; I was more interested in the technologies being used. As for location, I considered the entire Las Vegas area, as well as any interesting remote positions.</p>
<h3 id="technology-choice"><a href="#technology-choice">Technology Choice</a></h3><p>The language/technology used was the major factor I considered when looking at jobs. I would have liked to work with Go, but unfortunately Nevada seems to be bound hard to languages like C++, C#, Java, and JavaScript. Of these, I was already familiar with JavaScript, however I wanted to learn some Java over the summer to get a feel for it, since I believed that this stage of my career was the best time to experiment with my choice of language. Ideally, I wanted to use a stack that would be practical for both my work and my personal projects, however I didn&rsquo;t mind learning other stacks if only to broaden my horizons.</p>
<p>In theory, I know that language choice ultimately doesn&rsquo;t matter too much at this stage, but I&rsquo;d like to work with the technology I plan to be using in my personal life, rather than trying to juggle two stacks at the same time.</p>
<p>Not all jobs will use the exact same stack. I didn&rsquo;t think it was worth trying to learn every single piece of technology available for all applications. I think a better option would be to just focus on the most popular one or the one you want to use the most, and just sticking with that for a while. Mastery over one technology will make it easier to transfer to another, similar one.</p>
<p>Ideally, you should learn the technology that you like and makes sense for your career, but in reality you don&rsquo;t have a lot of leverage as a junior/entry-level developer to be doing this. It&rsquo;s always OK to learn things that you&rsquo;re interested in, but at this stage you will rarely get what you want. If you want to work in a particular field or location, then you should confirm the technologies being used there. Learn something employable. You can&rsquo;t focus all your time (yet) on doing the things that you like or want to do.</p>
<h2 id="job-hunting"><a href="#job-hunting">Job Hunting</a></h2><p>Google searches have provided a lot of value. Other sites I used include LinkedIn, Indeed, and ZipRecruiter.</p>
<h2 id="preparation"><a href="#preparation">Preparation</a></h2><h3 id="technical-interview"><a href="#technical-interview">Technical Interview</a></h3><p>I wasn&rsquo;t expecting much to be asked in the technical interview. Preparation for this was basically reviewing my notes from school and the textbooks I read.</p>
<h3 id="behavioral-interview"><a href="#behavioral-interview">Behavioral Interview</a></h3><p>Prepare scripts/stories to tell for the more common questions. Be able to talk about your previous projects. Maintaining a blog helps since everything you want to say is most likely on there. I prepared responses for the following questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>What text editor do you use?</li>
<li>What is your favorite project?</li>
<li>For each project:
<ul>
<li>How did it go?</li>
<li>What did you do?</li>
<li>What did you learn?</li>
<li>What went wrong?</li>
<li>What could have gone better?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>How did you know about this position?</li>
<li>How did you learn about technology X?</li>
<li>Tell me about your latest role.</li>
<li>What do you plan on being in 5 years?</li>
<li>What excites you?</li>
<li>What is something you&rsquo;ve had trouble with recently?
<ul>
<li>How would you change that?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>What&rsquo;s the worst mistake you ever made?</li>
<li>Tell me how you handled disagreements at work.</li>
<li>What&rsquo;s your growth plan? What do you want?</li>
<li>What&rsquo;s your favorite design pattern?</li>
<li>What&rsquo;s your greatest weakness? What&rsquo;s something you&rsquo;re not good at?</li>
<li>Give me a specific example of a time when you used good judgement and logic in solving a problem.</li>
<li>Give me an example of a time when you set a goal and were able to meet or achieve it.</li>
<li>Tell me about a time when you had to go above and beyond the call of duty in order to get a job done.</li>
<li>Tell me about a time when you had too many things to do, and you were required to prioritize your tasks.</li>
<li>Describe a time when you anticipated potential problems and developed preventative measures.</li>
<li>What questions do you have for us?</li>
<li>Tell me a little about yourself.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="coding-interview"><a href="#coding-interview">Coding Interview</a></h3><p>I basically just followed the study plan outlined here: <a href="https://www.techinterviewhandbook.org/coding-interview-prep/">https://www.techinterviewhandbook.org/coding-interview-prep/</a></p>
<p>I did have all summer to prepare, and could reasonably work through LeetCode questions, especially since I had the answers right in front of me. It is important to take your own notes on the solutions, and be able to identify what parts of one solution may be applicable to other problems.</p>
<h3 id="networking"><a href="#networking">Networking</a></h3><p>I grew up in Las Vegas, and knew some people graduating from UNLV during this time. I also noticed on LinkedIn that some of my peers from UNR also ended up working in the Las Vegas area as well.</p>
<h2 id="timeline"><a href="#timeline">Timeline</a></h2><p>I planned for this process to take the entire summer. My previous experience job hunting was during my junior year of college, and that went pretty terribly. I was a horrible interviewee, and I wanted to do things right this time around.</p>
<h3 id="april"><a href="#april">April</a></h3><p>I started seriously preparing my job application in mid to late April 2023. This mostly involved polishing up my blog and LinkedIn/Indeed portfolios. I did some preliminary searches in order to get a feel for the job market at the time. However, I had classwork to finish up and my job at the time was particularly busy, so job hunting took a secondary priority.</p>
<h3 id="may"><a href="#may">May</a></h3><p>The first half of May would be dedicated to planning out the rest of the summer. This involved making a timeline and gathering resources to study and prepare for my applications. I would make a schedule that would be followed for the summer which included working on side projects, practicing for interviews, and studying LeetCode. I then gathered whatever resources I would need in order to follow through with the plan. This might include buying textbooks, getting a notebook to record my progress, and generally preparing whatever material I would need.</p>
<p>I would like to work on all parts of my application at the same time instead of say, dedicating one month to coding, another month to interviewing, and another for whatever else. I think it&rsquo;s easier to work on each part of the application piece by piece every day rather than trying to focus on one particular aspect for a whole month.</p>
<h3 id="june"><a href="#june">June</a></h3><p>The rest of the summer would just be dedicated to working on the tasks I outlined in May. My plan may change as needed, but nonetheless most of my time would be spent working on my application. I wanted to send out some applications by the end of June just to check on my progress and see if my plan needs to be changed. If all goes well, I could get an offer I&rsquo;m happy with.</p>
<h3 id="july"><a href="#july">July</a></h3><p>July would be the same as June. Working on the parts of my application and sending out applications at the end of the month.</p>
<h3 id="august"><a href="#august">August</a></h3><p>If I couldn&rsquo;t get an offer I like by now, then August may be wholly dedicated to applying. Where the previous two months might be more focused on
<em>preparing</em> my application, August would be
<em>actually</em> applying. The end of summer may be when companies start to hire again, so there may be more jobs available around this time. I was prepared to go until August to find a job, and was pretty confident I would find something by then. If not, then there might have been some serious problems.</p>
<h2 id="resources"><a href="#resources">Resources</a></h2><p>I spent a lot of time gathering career advice and articles in preparation for this. Here are some of the more useful resources I&rsquo;ve found:</p>
