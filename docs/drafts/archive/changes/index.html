            <p>I can&rsquo;t keep waking up at 9am+ every day. I&rsquo;ll barely even get started on my todo list by 12PM. This isn&rsquo;t the life I want to live. I honestly don&rsquo;t know what started all of this but I know that listening to Reddit drama and music all the time won&rsquo;t make things better. Going cold turkey isn&rsquo;t a sustainable alternative either. These distractions will just slowly creep themselves back in until I write the 50 millionth come to Jesus journal entry like this one. How do I moderate my distractions? How do I get myself to work harder and longer? It seems the only things I&rsquo;m guaranteed to accomplish every day are brushing my teeth, working out, and eating 4 meals a day. I need some routine or structure in my life. I need control over my mind and my body again. Wake up on time. Don&rsquo;t fall back to sleep until at least 4 or 5pm. It doesn&rsquo;t matter what else you accomplish that day, as long as you can get up with your own power then that&rsquo;s proof enough that you still have control over yourself. If you can&rsquo;t do that much then you don&rsquo;t deserve to mess around. I know that my future self will forget half the emotion I feel writing this but fuck please don&rsquo;t let this go on. Practice waking up with the pomodoro timers again. Refocus by reading articles and HN rather than minesweeper. Eat to satiation and no more. Save your food for later. Minimize time downstairs I don&rsquo;t care what your mom says. Stick to the content blocks. Use headphones if you want but their usage should never conflict with any of the above.</p>
