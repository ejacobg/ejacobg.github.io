<p>Program what makes you happy, everyone else is already programming the rest. (<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36557764">keyle</a>)</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s very hard to keep moving once I&rsquo;ve hit my mental limit. It felt like I didn&rsquo;t even do that much today, yet I could barely get back to working after by most recent session. I spent like an hour on the phone and only then could I actually begin to write this. I did take a nap for ~90mins earlier today too. Maybe my cooldown time really is at least an hour long? Maybe I&rsquo;m severely underestimating the amount of (mental) rest I actually need. I can do two pomodoros back to back, but after that I&rsquo;m very burnt out. At the same time though, 1 hour breaks seem a little <em>too</em> excessive. Maybe I should consider a break <em>minimum</em> rather than maximum. I have to rest for at least X minutes before returning to work. Do some more poi. I&rsquo;ve been stuck with the 4-beat corkscrews/windmills because they hurt my arms to practice. Maybe work on some other movements that aren&rsquo;t so taxing. Or just clean and do the dishes or something.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve done as much as I can on the <em>physical</em> side of rest with the idea of active resting, however I&rsquo;ve consciously ignored my mental rest, which is arguably more important given the kind of work that I do.</p>
<p>Work on what makes you happy. This is ultimately the best and most self-sustaining kind of work. If I could do this, then I wouldn&rsquo;t be writing so much about how to optimize and force myself to get my working numbers up. I do realize the importance of the work that I do, but it is hard at times to stay focused and on task. My &ldquo;breaks&rdquo; are the only time I have where I can do things for my current self, not my future one. It feels like I spend more time breaking than working, and yet at the same time it feels like I&rsquo;m not that much closer to any of my personal goals. Be more conscious about how you&rsquo;re spending your free time. Don&rsquo;t spend it all watching YouTube videos, but at the same time don&rsquo;t force yourself to do or read something you&rsquo;re not entirely inclined to do at the moment. The key point here is to optimize for &ldquo;enjoyment&rdquo;. You <em>can</em> enjoy watching videos and you <em>can</em> enjoy reading, but at some point it becomes mindless and tiring. Maybe &ldquo;fulfillment&rdquo; is the better word for it.</p>
<p>There is an argument to be made for &ldquo;enjoyment&rdquo; though. I spent ~an hour on my phone today just reading manga and watching videos, and that seemed to have a better effect on my mental energy than the equivalent amount of napping or meditation/reflection. Of course, this may still need to be tested against other strategies like poi and music, but the fact remains clear: these things do provide <em>some</em> value to my life, maybe a little bit more than what my content blocks may suggest. I still do fear relaxing these blocks though, especially since I haven&rsquo;t considered alternatives, but I think that at least a little bit of time (maybe just a <em>little</em> bit more than what I currently allow for) can go a long way toward my mental energy and ultimately my productivity.</p>
<p>Remember that the goal of all this is to actually be able to get things done, both personally and professionally. Right now, that means grinding my textbooks and thinking about fixing my resume. However, this does not mean that I have to sacrifice everything that I enjoy, but rather the opposite. Spend time <em>actually doing</em> the things that you want; this gives you more energy to do the things that you don&rsquo;t. I&rsquo;m not too sure about what concrete actions this means though. Maybe work on the blog? Maybe work through your articles list? Maybe work on some of your current projects? Maybe spend a little time listening to music and walking around? In any case, find time to play and make sure to enjoy what you&rsquo;re doing, at least in your free time.</p>
