            <p>Usually I&rsquo;ll try to work on personal projects in between my textbook readings, and after <a href="https://ejacobg.com/notes/microservices-in-dotnet/#:~:text=Looking%20forward%2C%20I%E2%80%99ll%20try%20to%20come%20up%20with%20more%20of%20my%20own%20projects%20rather%20than%20follow%20along%20with%20a%20textbook.">my last reading</a>, I definitely needed something of my own to work on. I spent the last ~week trying to come up with some ideas, but nothing I came up with was particularly exciting or relevant to what I wanted to learn at the moment (currently microservices, Docker, and Kubernetes)</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never thought of myself as particularly creative, but I&rsquo;ve always had at least one potential project idea in the back of my mind that was within the realm of possibility. Its only now that my well has run dry that I come face-to-face with a situation that, looking back, has always been two steps behind me: I have now gone creatively bankrupt.</p>
<p>I find it hard to come up with ideas of my own, let alone ideas that actually seem worthy to put on a resume. If I&rsquo;m feeling particularly uncharitable, I could consider a lot of the projects on my GitHub to be cookie-cutter. Few of them have that catchy sales pitch like &ldquo;matcha-making robot arm&rdquo;. But anyone knows the flaws in their own work, and I&rsquo;m especially fond of disparaging others work as well. I have spent time on my projects and have learned a lot while making them. I just wish I was better able to articulate this to other people.</p>
<p>As usual, I&rsquo;m probably overreacting. I do have some potential ideas, but they aren&rsquo;t very fleshed out at the moment. Not that I actually <em>need</em> a coding project since there are always alternatives: reading and taking (and publishing) notes on a topic, writing stuff for the blog, or even just continue what I&rsquo;ve usually been doing - reading and following along with textbooks. I&rsquo;ve been thrashing around trying to find a project topic for over a week now, and it&rsquo;s time I actually committed to something.</p>
