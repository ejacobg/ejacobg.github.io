<p>Applying to jobs and interviewing has been particularly hard for me. For one thing, I find it difficult and somewhat embarrassing to write and talk about myself. Applying is inherently making yourself vulnerable. I forget facts about my own self and what I&rsquo;ve accomplished, and that forgetfulness can lead me to believe that I haven&rsquo;t done anything at all with my life. This is exaggerating of course, but if I <em>really</em> try hard to remember, my accomplishments don&rsquo;t seem as glamorous as I would have hoped.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;music as chores&rdquo; article feels like one of the better perspectives on my work. I&rsquo;m not sure exactly why though. It seems like associating my work with &ldquo;chores&rdquo;&ndash;something with a negative connotation&ndash;would make me less likely to want to work on them. In any case, I do <em>feel</em> productive, even if most of this time hasn&rsquo;t actually been tracked lately.</p>
