## Me

My name is Ean Jacob Gayban, but I go by Jacob. I'm a graduate from the University of Nevada, Reno, currently living in the Las Vegas area. I am currently seeking employment, particularly for a junior web or backend development position. I've been writing a lot of Go lately, but I've worked with several other languages during my time in college, including JavaScript, C++, C#, Elixir, and Python. I'm open to learning new languages and technologies, and plan to continue learning more to expand my repertoire. Java is next on the list of languages I plan to experiment with.

Outside of work (or lack thereof), I enjoy writing programs to make my life easier. I've written a web scraper to download recipes as JSON, a bookmark manager/read-it-later application for organizing links to saved articles, and a web application that was used by a local Esports league to rank their players. I spend a lot of time reading books on technology and programming (although it's mostly been about Go as of late), and have several books on my ever-growing reading list to get through. I realize that my journey is only just beginning and the fact that there's still so much left to learn excites me.

In my free time, I enjoy reading (mostly self-help and productivity), playing video games (I want to get back into [Rivals](https://rivalsofaether.com/)), and occasionally watching anime.

## This Site

I started this blog to help organize and share my thoughts and my projects. I've never had much of an online presence before, but have recently begun to see the value in having one. This blog is primarily tech-focused, but I plan to record whatever's interesting to me on here.

This site was built with the [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) static site generator, using a custom [theme](https://github.com/ejacobg/theme) that I wrote. It is hosted on GitHub Pages. You can find the site repository [here](https://github.com/ejacobg/ejacobg.github.io).

## My Projects

You can find the code for all of my projects on my [GitHub](https://github.com/ejacobg). Any non-coding projects will be documented here on this site.
