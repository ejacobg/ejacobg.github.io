## Year of (A)Vocation

I've been listening to a lot of [Cortex](https://www.relay.fm/cortex) lately and I managed to catch up with the latest episode right around theme season, so I thought I'd give the yearly themes a try.

### Description

This year I will be graduating from college and entering the workforce. A lot of time will be opening up for me, and I want to use it to develop both my personal and professional interests, both of which I feel haven't been given their proper attention.

On the personal (avocational) side, I want to develop the interests I've found recently, as well as exploring any new ones I may come across.

On the professional (vocational) side, I want to use this year to make a plan for my career, or at least find a direction I'm comfortable pursuing. I want to further my technical skills so I can build things for myself, as well as any prospective employers. Finally, I want to do my best at the job I currently have, while also preparing myself for the one that I want.

### Ideal Outcomes

Find full-time employment by the end of 2023.

Spend more time working on this site.

Gain proficiency in a tech stack of choice.

Read more, take notes, and develop my knowledge base.

Plan out short- and long-term career goals.

Explore interests, with a focus on having fun rather than striving for some goal.

### Daily Themes 

Have I made progress on a technical skill, course, book, or project?

Did I spend time on interests and hobbies (that aren't social media)?

Did I show up in-person at least 3 times this week?

Have I spent time looking for jobs or considering career paths?
