## Year of Diversification

*Note: [last year's theme](https://ejacobg.com/blog/yearly-theme-2023/) has now been updated with a retrospective.*

### Description

Last year, I thought I would have more time to myself after graduation since I no longer had any large responsibilities, but looking back it seems that the majority of my time and energy went into the job hunt. I neglected the personal side of last year's theme in favor of the job hunt, so now that that's over I'd like to try it again this year. The theme of diversification comes in two main parts.

**Diversification of Interests** - I finally have a source of income I can actually
*do* things with, so I'd like to put more time (and money) into the things I want to pursue (other than coding).

**Diversification of Responsibilities** - I imagine that this upcoming year will be marked by my having to balance a lot of new responsibilities at the same time. I want to use this year to get my life and affairs in order to not be as unbalanced as I was last year.

Ultimately though, the year of diversification is aimed at becoming able to manage all the various aspects of my life.

### Ideal Outcomes

Define short- and long-term career goals.

Make an accomplishment or complete a project in at least 3 different non-coding areas.

Continue maintaining the blog, and incorporate more `blog` and `notes` posts.

Buy a car or look into alternative methods of transportation.

Deepen my "home economics"/"adulting" knowledge and have a better grasp new responsibilities.

Develop my technical skills even further; get more comfortable using .NET.

### Daily Themes

Have I made progress on a technical skill, course, book, or project?

Are there any areas of my life that I haven't touched on in a while?

Did I do (or learn how to do) some chores/maintenance around the house?

Have I developed ideas for the blog, either through reading or writing?
